speaker_text: Okay, thank you Pam and what I will do today as I have done in the past is discuss first of all the results for the total Company for our second quarter. Then I can comment at on each of the business segments for the second quarter as well. Finally, I comment on the outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year 2003, which ends in June and then turn it over to you for the most useful part of our conference, which is the questions and answers, Bryan and Pam and I will be glad to take any questions from you. First of all for the total Company for the second quarter, we believe we had an excellent quarter both in regards to financial results and in taking specific actions to help improve results in future quarters. Sales were up 16% over last year's quarter. Our net income at the GAAP level was even with last year $0.25 per share but most significantly our GAAP operating income from the five segments was up 19% over last year's quarter giving great quality to our earnings for the quarter. The two government related segments continue to excel in every way, broad cash showed some very good recovery from disappointing first quarter and in Microwave we saw evidence that the worst of the telecom troubles maybe behind us while in our smallest business network support, we continue to lag in that business waiting for an upturn in spending from the regional bill operating companies. I don't have more detailed comments on each of the segments later. Overall net interest expense, our headquarters expense and our non-operating income all came in as expected. Cost reduction actions were carried out as we have previously announced in the Microwave business and we are expensed at slightly above $8 million in the quarter. The actions have been completed. Backlog increased for the Company as new orders were higher than sales. International orders improved significantly in both the Microwave and the Broadcast segments. International sales also stopped their slide and rebounded from 19% of sales in our first quarter to 22% of sales in the second quarter and that's on a higher sales level as well. Before discussing the individual segments let me turn to Bryan R. Roub for his comments regarding the continued good performance of cash flow and for other general comments regarding balance sheet items. Bryan

speaker_text: Thanks Phillip. The cash flow from operations in second quarter was really strong even stronger than first quarter was this year. We generated $38 million cash in the quarter from operations, which brought us to a total of $63 million from the first half of the year, so we are of to a flying start. Results in all of our businesses in the quarter were good, but the performance in particularly our government communications Broadcast in our communications businesses is simply stellar, they are really doing a great job. Equally, important is the absolute performance generation cash flow as the improvement in our relative performance are basically our ratios. Day sales outstanding declined 13%, after 65 days in the quarter and inventory turns increased 17% to 6.8% turns from first quarter levels, we do have a ways go to, those are not the world class ratios, but we continue to monitor these, we are working on them and then most important to me where we need to have improvement made. We have solutions under way although, the amount was modest, one point out one thing we did in the quarter, which we hadn't done for sometime, we bought back some health shares in the open market. We bought 100,000 shares at $24.40 when the price dropped in December. The point we felt, we could not pass off the opportunity to buy shares at a price that we felt was awfully cheap. As a result of the good performance cash and cash equivalence, at the end of the quarter totaled $380 million, that's up from $363 at the end of the first quarter. Net dept outstanding, which is that amount cash and cash equivalents less. Short and long-term debt has dropped to $35 million our network of 35 million basically or about flat and that's down about $50 million from where we started the beginning of the fiscal year. Total debt was 23.6% of total capital at end of the quarter. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $20 million, that's about double the second quarter last year and principally reflected increase in the government communications programs investments, particularly the network operating center for FTI win, which we wanted over this year that's itself is mostly the difference. For the full fiscal year, I believe the ranges for spending and deprecation, which we communicated on last call $70 million to $75 million spending and $55 million to $60 million for depreciation remained good ranges. Finally, for the full year my confidence that cash flow from operations we see the $100 million as increased to great deal two reason, obviously the first half performance we are more than half way there and our second half looks pretty robust, but also just the attention internally, on asset management given a lot help from the operating mangers gives me even more confidence, Phil Thank you.

speaker_text: Okay, I am going to talk about the individual segments and I will talk first about the telecom related businesses those are the two obviously were the weakest markets and we have some good views to report there, first Microwave, we have very encouraging quarter in Microwave sales at $75 million were up 4% from last year second quarter and we had a very strong bounce back from the first quarter of this when we hit a low of $56 million and caused a great deal concern for many of you out there. Supplier problems that we talked about last quarter were solved and we are shipping products that were a problem for us at the end of last quarter. New orders were up 12% over last year and up a very strong 22% sequentially over the first quarter. The cost reduction actions, which cost $8.3 million were completed as I mentioned earlier, we are up and operating at the new consolidated US engineering facility in Rollider, North Carolina and we have shift engineering operations entering the process of closing down the facilities in Seattle Washington in Torrents, California and completing the engineering move out of Redwood shores, California. Most encouraging, the operating profit of the division was at a breakeven level except for the cost reduction actions and the primary benefits of those cost reductions actions will occur in future quarters and we are not with this in the second quarter. North American sales continue to be very strong, reaching about 50% of total sales primarily serving the cellular and PCS backhaul applications area, along with a steady private network market. International sales rebounded from the very low first quarter results and point-to-multipoint our BWA products have started to ramp up as well. In terms of areas of strength, Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe are all strong areas for our microwave business while South America remains very weak and for us, China was weak during the quarter. The overall outlook for the business has definitely improved. Sales levels of $70 million per quarter or better appear realistic in the near term and that that level with a new cost structure, the business should be breakeven or better. As the market recovers, the leverage for profitable performance has been greatly enhanced. Since the quarter ended, we have received a $17 million order wholly financed from Nigeria to install a point-to-multipoint system with voice and data capability. We have worked with the customer Oduva for several months to develop a solid business plan, which we believe has a great chance of success. The contract with Oduva is successful, could double or triple in size in future quarters or years. Now turning to our network support. Network support is of course our smallest business, and we had another weak quarter there. We lost $2.5 million as sales declined to $12.1 million. The radical cost reductions over the past two years of course minimized that loss. Our head count is actually down from 481 to 210, a 56% reduction over that period while expenses are also down 56% from $16 million to $7 million on a quarterly basis. Our major customers, the Bell, Visual Bell operating companies have continued their tight cost controls and are still holding down purchases of tools and test equipment to levels equal to half of normal rates. We remain confident that they will increase those purchases at some point but so far they have not. Unfortunately, our costs are as bad as low as they can go and still continue to operate as a business. We simply need more sales. Unfortunately, we do have opportunities that we believe can help hopefully in the near-term rather than the long-term. We have new products in field test, some that have completed field test and are ready to go. On the positive note or at least what we hope is a positive note, the SEC appears ready to modify some of the onerous regulations that emanated from the 1996 Telecom Act, particularly the provision that allow third party use of DELL infrastructure at every low cost, if the SEC follows through on those actions as they have hinted there could be a very positive effect on capital spending by the Bell companies and if so we believe we would benefit. Meanwhile, we were just hanging on in the business. Turning now to broadcast, we had an excellent comeback from that disappointing first quarter. Sales were up 19% over the last year's quarter and a very strong 39% over the first quarter. Operating income recovered from quarter one is $2 million profit, rising to $6 million in the second quarter. But that is well below in last year's as $.9.7, the decrease in profitability from last year is primarily due to shift in product mix to non-digital products that have a lower margins for us. International orders as we predicted came back very strongly, led by a $65 million contract to install new AM radio stations throughout the country of Romania and to link those stations into a network controlled by Harris's net loss, network management system. We also received a very large systems order for a high power AM radios from China and we receive some very good automation orders from Germany and from Asia. Digital television remained on track with market share holding above 60%. The small market broadcasters as we have reported earlier are still ordering minimal capability systems and more likely continue to do so at some level until the SEC levied a full power requirement on them which we believe they will certainly have to do within the next year. Digital TV products are the divisions highest profit products, which is wonderful news for the future. Dollar volume and dollar's profit will increase significantly when those stations upgrade to full power to more expensive transmitters and encoders, which they must do. Meanwhile, I am happy to report also that digital radio is gaining traction with significant sales anticipated in the second half of this fiscal year. Profits margin on digital radio are similar to digital TV margins, per house and that is very good news. The outlook for our final two quarters, quarter three and quarter four for broadcast is good with sales anticipated to be about last year's level for the both the second half and also for the total year as well. Operating income in the second half is expected to be about 10% of sales or better as it was last year, but because of the weak income and quarters well into, the total year profit will be below last year's level as we will be unable to make up for that shortfall entirely. We're confident that the second half profit performance will be better than the first half because of the backlog that we are working on consisting of new digital radio sales, some excellent projects in systems and the studios product line and additional sales and profit growth in automation products. We also expect to see a slightly higher percentage of large digital TV transmitters as waivers began to expire and at some upgrade start to recur. In the long term, the outlook remains extremely bright as Harris continues to strengthen its number one position in the broadcast equipment market in both television and in radio. Turning now to our RF communication's radio division. We're running out of adjective here, we had another outstanding quarter. Sales were up about 18% over last year and also 18% over our very strong first quarter. Operating income was up 68% from last year and operating income hit a remarkable 25% of sales for the quarter. Equally remarkable, the return on capital employee for the business was in excess of a 125% for the quarter and all of this growth and performance is organic. These are absolutely superb financial performance statistics for a government products business. The Falcon-II radio product line is without a doubt, the undisputed choice for the war on terrorism for U.S. forces and for our international alliance. The sales mix for the quarter was 47% and U.S. sales and 53% internationally, a little higher domestic orders than usual as the U.S. government force is needed more radios for upcoming activities. The sales increase obviously was driven by the superiority of the Falcon II product line. While the profit increase is being driven by continuing productivity improvements in manufacturing and by volume impact on this heavily software in terms of product line. The new orders were also strong. They were higher than sales, and with a good mix of both international and domestic. In terms of the two major programs, the $200 million plus Bowman Program remains unscheduled and our first production deliveries were expected in the March timeframe. The cluster one joint tactical radio system program for the U.S. military also continues unscheduled, and it is currently in its part of diphase. Orders from some new customers in the Philippines and in Algeria will add to the growing list of countries that are now adopted the Falcon-II radio but as good as that performance in RF communication radio was, the results in our government communications system division may be even more encouraged. Sales growth was 24% over last year's quarter and all this growth is organic. The operating income grew 21%. Growth was across all product lines in this very large division led by activities in the classified area. We had a very healthy mix of business, no single program or contract can close to 10% of sales. New orders also remained strong. They were higher than sales and our backlog grew further. Cash flow was also very strong, well above operating income and return on capital employed in this business, which is a very labor in terms of business was a robust plus 30% in terms of return on capital employee. We're obviously going to have to revise our growth objectives for the year again, we're now quite confident that sales and profit are going to grow above 15% for the total year compared to last year. The business characteristics remain very comfortable within the mix that we know how to manage about 60% of our contracts are cost reimbursable, now 40% are fixed price. We have about 40% of our business directly where the U.S. government about 60% with "Primes" which serve the U.S. government. Our new program that we won within the past year, the very large ones, are all on track and off to a very good start including the "Joint-Strike Fighter" the FTI program where the Federal Aviation Agency, our mass Tiger program with the U.S. Census Bureau and our support programs in our Harris Tactical support services business. Ongoing programs continue to perform well as are the new ones. The F22 program, the [BLANK] program, the F18 program, the Future Imagery Architecture Satellite program and others are all performing as planned and continuing to grow. We also had a very significantly occurred during the quarter and that we're building a product, which we believe, is going to be a very hot product for US government markets. We have developed a capability which we call Setnet [ph] which essentially is a circuit board that when inserted into PCs or laptops enables the PC or the laptop to have type one secure wireless network communications at speeds of 12 megabits or higher. The significant thing that occurred during the quarter is, this capability was certified by the National Security Agency or used by the US government forces. It is the only product that is so certified. We expect this product to achieve annual sales levels of $10 million or more within a year or so. We also had two major programs that we talked about on our last call that we are nearing award, both of those are still pending. First, the next comp program with the FAA, the next comp program is the communications network and ground systems for the next generation digital radio traffic or air traffic control. We expect that to be awarded literally any day. There will be two awards, and we hope that Harris will be one of the companies that receives one of those. The other major program was the advanced EHS terminal program. These are set time terminals that go aboard all navy ships and looks as if the award of that program will be in April now, we had expected it in December or January. There will also be two winners for that program most likely, and again we hope that Harris will be one of those winners. We have remained very active in homeland security, but in the homeland security area, most programs are still in the formative stage. We are actively involved, but we have nothing to report at this time and that would be a significant win as the government is still in the planning phase. I am now looking at the outlook for the full year for our fiscal 2003, which ends in June. Overall, we feel much better about the potential for this year. Net income is expected to yield earnings per share in the 130 to 140 range and if expenses for the second quarter cost reduction actions and microwave are excluded, EPS is expected to be at the top end of that range. We have included in those estimates on lower total year operating income for the broadcast division as I commented on earlier based on continued purchases of minimally compliant configurations of digital TV equipment. Of course, we expect to recover those sales and earnings as broadcasters upgrade the full power equipment in FY04 and beyond which of course they must do. There are some definite signs of improvement for the microwave business, at least for Harris. We are hopeful that sales of $70 million or better per quarter is achievable in the near term, and we believe it is, and if so, the recent cost reductions will help ensure the breakeven or profitable business. We of course remained very comfortable with the strong outlook for the two government related segments, and with that let me turn the session over to you, Bryan, Allen, and I are available and will be happy to entertain your questions.

If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the * key followed by the digit 1 on your touchtone telephone. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure you mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. We will proceed in the order that you signal us and take as many question as time permits. Once again, please press * 1 if you have a question. We will pause for just a moment to give everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. Our first question will come from Rich Blura of Needham and Company. Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations on a very nice turn around from last quarter. Well, thank you. Analyst: Few questions on broadcast if I could. Last quarter you talked about the ASPs and the digital transmitters and you mentioned they improved somewhat this quarter. Could you quantify those little better how much does ASPs and digital transmitters increased quarter-over-quarter? Answer: Yes, last quarter they were 209,000, and this quarter they're right about 300,000. Analyst: Okay, and as a percentage of your total business, what were the digital, can you give us what with the digital transmitters were for this quarter, I mean, of the broadcasted business, I am sorry Answer: It was around 30% or 31% of the business and of course we expect that to be higher in the future when they start buying higher priced equipment. Analyst: And you mentioned that you expected the digital radio to start coming on should be in the second half of this fiscal years, so if you have to lookout, you know, be it 12 months from now, and your total percentages of digital products, which appeared to be your highest margin products, would you expect it to be, I assume higher than it is now, higher than 30%? Answer: Rich, yes, I am going avoid specific numbers simply because I don't have them and we haven't gotten our next year's plans ready for communication externally yet, but the answer is definitely yes. We expect next year to have higher percentage of digital products. We expect that higher percentage of digital TV products as the upgrades for full power and as redundancy, and as the final buys begin to take place in PDS, we also expect to have digital radio kicking in as well, so we expect ultimately and I can't pick the month for the quarter but clearly the digital products are going to be larger than all other the products, you know, is our hope at some point here. Analyst: If you could give us a feeling for your conviction on or your thoughts on when those digital upgrades sort of have to start happening and when do you think with the mandated full power of requirements, when would you expect to see those start kicking in, could you? Answer: Richard, originally, let me point out very clearly; our business is not under our controls, on the control of the SEC to one extent, originally or early on the SEC had an interim milestone guideline that they had put in place for December 31st 2000 and forward, that everyone had to be an interim guideline and is not currently a guideline. Clearly, they're going to put something like that in place probably over the next year. I don't know from whether they will pick that same one December 31st, 2004. I would expect, you know, I would be shocked if they were way beyond that, maybe it could be a half a year or year later than that but certainly not any more than that assuming that they remain committed which they have to the 2006 completion of installation of the infrastructure. So, it's going to have to happen, and I expect over the next year, we're going to see that guideline put in place, and I expect it will be somewhere between December 31st, 2004, and let's say kind of an outside December 31st, 2005, and then, of course, the broadcasters have to react ahead of that when the requirement is placed upon them.

speaker_text: Great, and one final question just on the government communications great year-over-year revenue growth, pretty solid operating margins down a bit, I guess sequentially, can you just give us a feel for where you would expect the operating margins for that business to trend for the balance of the year?

speaker_text: Yes, we clearly, you know, kind of have a bottom margins that internally we put on the guidance, which is, we expect to see at least the 9% operating profit are better. Clearly, they are meeting our expectations there, and I certainly don't expect them the fall short at any point. So, that's pretty good performance given our mix of cost reimbursable in fixed price business. Overtime, as the business move more to production phases of some of the programs such as those large aircraft programs and satellite programs then we would expect the business returns slightly higher overall margins, and at that point, we would begin to look for 10% or better margins, but right now, they're doing pretty well. So, we can't place it where we are at this point. Great, that's it. Thank you. You're welcome.
